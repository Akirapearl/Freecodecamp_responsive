            Computers are probably the most important part of our daily life now a days, they provide
            communication with people all over the world, as well as any type of information we could need. <br>
            But, even if we had the same number of computers, those would be mostly useless without a way to communicate with
            each other, that channel of communication is what we know as "The internet", or just "Internet".
        </p>

<section class="main-section" id="About_the_internet">
    <header>
    <h3>About the internet</h3>
    </header>
        <p>
            The internet is not a new thing, in fact it all started back in the 1960s when the United States's defense department<br>
            started to build the ARPANET, a network that was intended to be a point of communication between universities all over <br>
            that country. <br>
            The time went on and now there are billions of computers connected to each other via huge networks, connected between each other as well. <br>
        </p>

    <h3>First data transmision</h3>
    </header>
        <p> When we talk about internet, most of the people think about themselves sitting in front of their computer or smart phone, <br>
        but that was not there since the beginings, in fact, it was not until the early 1990s that <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners Lee</a> <br>
        created the first client-server connection when it all started. That moment was when the actual www protocol and the internet started as well.
    
        </p>
        <code>
            ping
        </code>
        <p>
        Now you can see two type of console commands, the first one is intended to check if two diferent nodes "see" each other, so they can send messages. <br>
        The other two are used on Windows and Gnu/Linux systems respectively to see the IP of the current pc/device the user is at. <br>
        The IP is just a identification number of the device, intended to be used through different types of communication through networks and the internet itself.

        </p>
        <code>
            ipconfig
        </code>
     
        <code>
            ifconfig
        </code>

        But...how do actually two nodes (one server and one client on each point) communicate with each other?. <br>
        We use a specific type of program called Browser, a browser is intended to be an interpreter of different <br>
        languages, all of them written with a different purpose, HTML being the basic and probably the most important one among <br>
        all of the current existent ones. <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Html</li>
        <li>Css</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Php</li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/"> Learn more about web developing... </a></li>
    </ul>
    <code>
        html_example        
    </code>
    <code>
        css_sample
    </code>
    
    <p>HTML stands for hypertext markup language, its the most basic language that a browser can read <br>
        A web developer who uses html needs to create a generic structure inside what they will use differnt tags <br>
    inside "<>" characters, each of those with a different function.</p>
    <p> CSS stands for cascade style sheet, it is intended to be a language that gives more functionality to a plain <br>
    and basic html file, it can be used to set colors, sizes, even animation or responsive behavior for different screen sizes!</p>
    <p> The above mentioned languages are part of what we call frontend, it can be defined as the part of the web that the user see <br>
    at their screen when they look for any particular website.</p>

    <h3>Present and future</h3>
    </header>
    <p>We have covered a little about the internet at the basic languages that are used to display a website but, how about the actual <br>
    workarounds, what do developers use to create their sites? is anything new and revolutionary coming to scene?</p>
    <p>Well, in fact, despite html and css are enough to build a "basic" site, now a days most of the developers use different frameworks that help them <br>
    to create more complex and advanced sites within less time writing code, that has evolved into new trends called "nocode" that consist as they say, writing <br>
    websites with no code, just graphical edition with drag and drop elements, with all the lines of code being interpreted on the background.</p>
